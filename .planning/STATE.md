# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-13)

**Core value:** Accurate cross-entity supplier deduplication with human-in-the-loop merge — every match is reviewed, every field choice is tracked, every golden record has full provenance.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Foundation + Ingestion Pipeline

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4 phases following pipeline dependencies — Foundation+Ingestion → Matching → Review+Merge → Browse+Dashboard
- [Roadmap]: Auth (OPS-03) and audit trail (OPS-04) placed in Phase 1 as cross-cutting infrastructure
- [Roadmap]: WebSocket notifications (OPS-05) placed in Phase 2 alongside matching engine
- [Roadmap]: Use rapidfuzz instead of thefuzz (per research — 10-100x faster, MIT licensed)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Embedding model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) is English-trained — may underperform on French/German company names. Test with real data in Phase 2.
- [Research]: Optimal blocking K parameter (20 vs 30 vs 50) needs empirical tuning with real data in Phase 2.
